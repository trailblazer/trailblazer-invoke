# Trailblazer::Invoke

Implements the top-level invocation method `#__()`.

TODO: add some more description here :D

invoke is about "centralizing" how OPs and activities are called, configuring what gets injected, and provides a matcher block syntax

E.g. when you want to have a "global" wtf? ENV variable
